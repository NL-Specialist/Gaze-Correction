# Gaze-Correction
## Overview
In video call scenarios, achieving eye contact is difficult because participants usually have to
focus on the camera, not the screen. Therefore a technique is introduced for obtaining and
adjusting the user’s gaze effectively. This technique utilises advanced algorithms to detect
gaze, classify the gaze according to the direction the user is looking, and then correct the gaze
to focus on the camera. Comprising of two key components, Gaze Classification and Gaze
Correction, this system takes a holistic approach to enhance gaze correction dynamics. The
Gaze Classification component employs advanced algorithms to precisely locate, identify and
classify the user’s gaze, ensuring accurate tracking of eye and head movements. The Gaze
Correction componenet utilises various image processing techniques to adjust the user’s gaze,
seamlessly aligning it with the camera
